# Leaf Disease Detection
## Overview
This project aims to develop an automatic leaf disease detection system using deep learning techniques. By leveraging image processing and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the system categorizes plant leaves as either healthy or infected. This tool is designed to assist farmers and agricultural professionals in early disease detection, ultimately improving crop yield and sustainability.
## Features

    Image-based classification of plant leaves.
    Utilizes deep learning techniques for accurate disease detection.
    Implements k-fold cross-validation to optimize model performance.
    User-friendly interface for easy integration into agricultural applications.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of images categorized into two classes:

    Healthy
    Infected (includes diseases such as Anthracnose, Leaf Crinkle, Powdery Mildew, and Yellow Mosaic)
